To clone this repo from github run:

``git clone git+https://github.com/paulthebaker/ecc_prior@master``

Features
--------

* compute centroids of future and pasts GW burst in time-frequency plane based on physically motavated meta-parameters.
* compute prior probability for a burst at any (t,f) location based on meta-parameters.
* follows the conventions of Loutrel and Yunes (2017) [LY2017]_.
* included ``Jupyter`` notebooks use the `ceedub <https://github.com/paulthebaker/ceedub>`_ package for wavelet transforms.
